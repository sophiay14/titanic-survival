Compared to first-class passengers, those in second class had only about 30% the odds of survival, while those in third class had less than 10%. Males had dramatically reduced odds of survival (odds ratio ≈ 0.09). Age had a smaller but still meaningful effect: each additional year decreased survival odds by about 3%. The factor impact plot clearly shows that sex and class dominate survival outcomes, with age playing a secondary role.\n\n\nPredicted Survival Probabilities\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prediction curves show strong interactions between sex, age, and class. Across all classes, women had much higher predicted survival probabilities than men. Younger passengers had better chances, but the survival gap between males and females was consistent: even older women in first class had better odds than younger men in lower classes. This visual confirms the historical accounts of “women and children first” and the importance of class status.\n\n\nModel Evaluation\n\n\n          Actual\nPredicted  Died Survived\n  Died       71       17\n  Survived    8       47\n\n\n[1] 0.8251748\n\n\nThe model correctly classified most passengers: 71 who died and 47 who survived were predicted correctly, with relatively few misclassifications (17 false negatives and 8 false positives). The overall accuracy was about 82.5%, indicating strong predictive power for a simple model.\n\n\nROC and AUC Curve\n\n\nSetting direction: controls &lt; cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea under the curve: 0.8836\n\n\nThe ROC curve demonstrates that the model discriminates well between survivors and non-survivors. The AUC of 0.88 confirms this performance: far better than random guessing (0.5) and in the range considered “very good.” This means the model reliably ranks passengers by their survival probability, even if classification thresholds shift."

    "text": "This report presents an analysis of survival outcomes from the Titanic dataset using logistic regression and data visualization.\nThe study evaluates the influence of passenger class, gender, and age on survival probabilities. Results indicate that survival was strongly associated with gender and class: women and first-class passengers had substantially higher survival rates, while men and third-class passengers faced markedly lower odds. Age also played a significant role, with survival probability decreasing steadily as age increased. The logistic regression model quantifies these relationships, providing a clear statistical framework for understanding the factors that shaped survival on the Titanic.\n\nSurvival by Gender\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of survival outcomes by gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival by Class\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of survival outcomes by passenger class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender and Class Interaction\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved and predicted survival by gender and class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved and predicted survival by gender and class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved age distributions and predicted survival probabilities by age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved age distributions and predicted survival probabilities by age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge v.

    "text": "Pictogram showing survival outcomes among Titanic passengers.\n\n\n\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic was not only a maritime disaster but also a revealing case study of how social structures influenced survival. The data make clear that women and first-class passengers had far greater chances of survival, while men, third-class travelers, and older individuals faced far lower odds. Logistic regression confirms these patterns: men had survival odds reduced by nearly 91% (95% CI: 87%–95%), third-class passengers by 91% (95% CI: 84%–95%), and each additional year of age lowered survival odds by about 3% (95% CI: 2%–5%)."
