My name is Sophia Yao and I am currently a student at Abbey Park High School. You can find more of my work on [Github](https://github.com/sophiay14) and feel free contact me at sophia.jiani.yao@gmail.com.

This project uses the Titanic dataset obtained from [Kaggle’s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The dataset contains demographic and survival information for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic such as sex, class, and age. The code is avaible on my [Github repository]().

This project was created as a part of [Kane’s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
