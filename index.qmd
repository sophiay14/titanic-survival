The sinking of the Titanic was not only a maritime disaster but also a revealing case study of how social structures influenced survival. The data make clear that women and first-class passengers had far greater chances of survival, while men, third-class travelers, and older individuals faced far lower odds. Logistic regression confirms these patterns: men had survival odds reduced by nearly **91% (95% CI: 87%–95%)**, third-class passengers by **91% (95% CI: 84%–95%)**, and each additional year of age lowered survival odds by about **3% (95% CI: 2%–5%)**.
