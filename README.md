# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate a **logistic regression model** predicting passenger survival based on age, sex, and passenger class.

## Project Structure
- `model.qmd` — Quarto document containing the analysis, R code, and visualizations.  
- `figures/` — Plots generated by the model (odds ratios, predicted probabilities, ROC curve).  
- `data/` — Input dataset(s).  

## Analysis Overview
- Fit a logistic regression model with predictors: `Pclass`, `Sex`, and `Age`.  
- Interpreted coefficients and odds ratios.  
- Visualized factor impacts, predicted survival probabilities, and ROC/AUC for model performance.  
- Evaluated classification accuracy with a confusion matrix.  

## Requirements
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (≥ 4.0)  
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (for rendering reports)  
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `broom`, `ggplot2`, `pROC`  

## Running the Project
1. Open `model.qmd` in RStudio (or your editor).  
2. Render the document:  
   ```bash
   quarto render model.qmd
3. The output will appear in the _site/ folder, and you can view it locally in your browser.

## Results Summary
- Sex and class were the strongest predictors of survival.
- Females and higher-class passengers had much higher survival odds.
- The model achieved an accuracy of ~82.5% and an AUC of 0.88, indicating strong discriminative ability.
